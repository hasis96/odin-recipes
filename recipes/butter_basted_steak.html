    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>High smoke point oil, such as canola or avocado</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Thyme orRosemary</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Cast Iron Pan</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Salt the steak generously and leave it uncovered in the fridge for at least a couple hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Let the cast iron pan pre-heat until it starts to smoke, then add just enough oil to cover the surface of the pan.</li>
            <li>Sear both sides and the fat cap, and a few minutes before your preferred done-ness is achieved, add the garlic, butter, and herbs.</li>
            <li>Once the butter is melted, tilt the pan towards you and start spooning the garlic and herb infused butter onto the steak.
                This will help with cooking the steak evenly, but also add flavor to the steak!
